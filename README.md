# python-makefile-example
This is an example of makefile for non compiled language

A use case of makefile for such language is when your program generates some sort of output (`target`)

---
Simply run `make` and you will see targets being created the first time.

The second time you run `make`, you will see "`make: Nothing to be done for 'all'.`". This is because the prerequisites aren't changed; thus, it will save you time from executing the program again.

That's it. This minimal example should give you enough idea to get you started.
